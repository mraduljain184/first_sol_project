# Solidity First Project

This repo contains my first Solidity smart contracts, built and deployed using **Remix IDE** and **Sepolia testnet**.

## Contracts
- `Counter.sol` – Simple increment/decrement counter
- `TodoList.sol` – To-do list with add/complete/delete tasks

## How I ran it
1. Opened [Remix](https://remix.ethereum.org)
2. Compiled with Solidity ^0.8.28
3. Deployed using MetaMask → Sepolia testnet
4. Interacted with contracts via Remix terminal

## Files
- `contracts/` → Solidity contracts
- `artifacts/` → ABIs + build metadata
